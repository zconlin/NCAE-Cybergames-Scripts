Any areas where ${} appears means it is a replaceable variable. Replace the whole text,
including ${} with your text.
Below are the variables that will be used throughout the guide.

Variable Value
${EXTERNAL_IP} 172.16.4.3
${EXTERNAL_NETMASK} 255.255.248.0
${EXTERNAL_GATEWAY} 172.16.0.1
${EXTERNAL_DNS} 172.16.0.1
${INTERNAL_IP} 192.168.3.1
${INTERNAL_GATEWAY} 255.255.255.0
${NETMASK} 24

Replace any instances of t with your team number. Alternatively, for a private setup,
just use 1 for simplicity.

Hostname Configuration
Edit your hostname with
vi /etc/hostname
or by pasting the following command to use the hostname router:
echo router >> /etc/hostname
It is not required to set the hostname.

Network Interface Configuration
For a proper configuration, you will have two network interfaces for an internal and
external zone (unless both internal and external zones reside on the same network
interface, see [single interface configuration](#Single Interface Configuration)).

Multi-interface Configuration
We will assume eth0 is your external interface. Swap the instructions if eth0 is internal.
Open up your ifcfg-eth0 configuration:
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

Set the following lines to the values corresponding, or create the lines if they don't exist.
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR="${EXTERNAL_IP}"
NETMASK="${EXTERNAL_NETMASK}"
GATEWAY="${EXTERNAL_GATEWAY}"
DNS1="${EXTERNAL_DNS}"
ZONE=external

Reload the interface after saving the changes above.
systemctl restart network

After doing this, you should be able to ping the upstream gateway (172.18.0.1).
Doing so will validate that external routing is properly configured.

Open up your ifcfg-eth1 configuration:
vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1

Set the following lines to the values corresponding, or create the lines if they don't exist.
You DO NOT need to delete every other line in this file.
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR="${INTERNAL_IP}"
NETMASK="${INTERNAL_NETMASK}"
DNS1="${INTERNAL_DNS}"
ZONE=internal

Restart your network before continuing to configuration of the firewalld firewall with the
following command:
systemctl restart network

Firewalld
Zones
An internal zone resides on your "internal" network interface, which would host the
interface to connect your hosts to your router as a gateway.
An external zone resides on your "external" network, which would normally be mapped to
your external IP address via DHCP, often assigned by an internet service provider. This
can reside on the same interface as your internal zone depending on your configuration.

IP Forwarding
Modify the /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf file with:
vi /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf
and add the following line to the file:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Alternatively, you could paste this to your terminal:
echo net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 > /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.con

Reload IP Forwarding Configuration
Execute the following command to reload the ip_forward.conf configuration file.
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/ip_forward.conf

Enable IP Masquerading
This will allow IP masquerading across the internal and external interfaces.
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --passthrough ipv4 -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE -s ${INTERNAL_IP}/${NETMASK}
If you are unsure what the netmask CIDR is for your installation, you could use
${INTERNAL_IP}/24 by default.

Assign interface to external zone
For this tutorial, eth0 is our external interface. Depending on your setup, this could be
swapped. Assign eth0 to our external interface with the following command:
firewall-cmd --change-interface=eth0 --zone=external --permanent

Set internal zone as default
Set the internal zone as the default zone for firewalld to perform routing with:
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=internal

Reload firewalld so your changes take effect:
firewall-cmd --complete-reload

List Firewall Rules
You can list your firewall rules on your internal and external zones with the following
commands:
firewall-cmd --list-all
firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=external
firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=internal

Port Forwarding
Some services may require a port forward on the router to properly score. Refer to the
topology map to help determine which servers may require a port forward.
Example:
firewall-cmd --zone=external --add-forwardport=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=80:toaddr=192.168.t.5

Configure an internal host
After all is said and done, it's not very useful to have your CentOS host configured as a
router if you don't use it. Be sure you have a host connected on the same interface as the
internal interface of your router.
Configure a static address on your machine using your router's internal IP address as your
gateway; be sure your netmask and address are on the same subnet as your gateway
address is on.
Validate Connectivity
External Interface
firewall-cmd --complete-reload
firewall-cmd --list-all
firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=external
firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=internal
firewall-cmd --zone=external --add-forwardport=port=80:proto=tcp:toport=80:toaddr=192.168.t.5
At this point, both your external and internal interfaces should be configured. As long as
DNS is setup, you should be capable of pinging Google and getting a response similar to
below:

Internal Interface
You should also be able to ping your shell server from the internal network at this point so
long as it is online.
